##Election Audit Summary
An advantage to this script is the ability to manipulate it for all elections. To do this we would simply transpose the updated election’s results into a .csv file with the same format as this year’s and update the script to reference that file.  A further modification that I would recommend is breaking down the votes each candidate received in each county to see not only the voter turnout in those counties but what their outcomes were in terms of candidate popularity.
